This is a bare-bones client-side implementation of the [Internet Relay Chat (IRC) messaging protocol](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1459.html) for my [Twitch Bot](https://github.com/viral32111/twitch-bot).

## üìú Background

I made this for use in my [Twitch Bot](https://github.com/viral32111/InternetRelayChat) as the [Twitch Chat API](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/irc/) operates over IRC.

This [was originally hardcoded into the bot](https://github.com/viral32111/twitch-bot/tree/961fc729a8fc151686eb3e7c2c371768c9a81f7f/Source/InternetRelayChat). However, I separated it into its own project in January of 2023 to ease development.

I also wanted a project to try out automated unit testing and test-driven development in .NET for the first time.
